          <p>Hello! My name is Srutilaya Mani, or Sruti and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. I have many goals for my future and would like to major in Biotechnology or Computer Science at the leading schools of UC Davis, UC Berkeley, or UC Irvine. To achieve these goals I plan on working hard throughout highschool and taking classes both in and out of school that relate to my future major. <br><br> I excel in math but typically do well in all of my subjects and I like to challenge myself with many AP classes and strive to learn as much as possible in every class.<br><br> In addition to academics, I enjoy dancing and am part of a school team called Dublin Afsana and dance outside of school with a professional instructor. I have been dancing for two years and plan to continue pursuing the art. In addition, I play badminton at Bintang Badminton Academy and have been playing on and off for about five years. I am a purple belt in Shotokan karate, and enjoy helping younger children. In my free time, I enjoy working out, painting, and hanging out with my friends.<br><br>At Dublin High School, I am the treasurer of the Engineering and Design Club, a club that allows students to design objects to solve issues around the world. From this experience, I learned how to think creatively and think about multiple aspects when solving problems.<br><br>Throughout my highschool career, I plan on taking many engineering classes and AP Biology because I enjoy both subjects and would like to major in Biotechnology in the future. This major combines my love for Biology and Engineering. Workers in this field have many different opportunities in the future.<br><br>
          Overall, I have many skills and I plan on continuing all of my hobbies and prioritize school as well. I hope to succeed in the future with my hard work and dedication to my passions. Contact me at sruzics@gmail.com with any further questions!</p>
