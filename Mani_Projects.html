          <strong>Scratch Project</strong>
            <h6>The Capture of Princess Isabella</h6>
            <h6>Course: AP Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <h6>Duration: Approximately 1 week (September 3, 2019 - September 11, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective:To create a story that is user interactive with an outcome based on the user's decisions</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Pair Project</h6>
              <p>For the Scratch Project, my partner and I decided to create a story that allowed users to make decisions throughout the story that would determine the outcome of the story. The story’s overall plot was revolved around the prince saving a captured princess. The user has to make decisions for the prince as he goes through the forest. These simple decisions will determine if the prince gets to the princess and saves her, or gets captured by the evil witch. My partner and I made many compromises in order for the project to be successful and an outcome of both of our desires. This was my first time coding, so it definitely was a big challenge, but it ended up working at the end. This project taught me the fundamentals of coding and how a computer interprets code exactly the way it is written. It familiarized me with the coding world with a simple language that is easy for beginners to follow.<br><br><br>Click the link on the left to test our Scratch story!</p>

          <strong>MIT App Inventor Project</strong>
            <h6>Paint Pot</h6>
            <h6>Course: AP Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <h6>Duration: Approximately 2 weeks (September 3, 2019 - September 11, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective:To create an app that allows users to draw on a blank canvas or on a picture with a variety of features.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Pair Project</h6>
              <p>For the MIT App Inventor Project, my partner and I followed a simple tutorial to create a drawing app called “Paint Pot” which we customized to adhere to our high standards. The app consists of a canvas where users can draw on with a pen and can customize the size and color of their strokes to their desire. The app allows the user to take a picture and draw on the picture as well. There are multiple eraser tools within the app, one that just erases whatever the user drags, one that erases all the pen marks, and one that resets the whole page, including the background. Once the user finishes their drawing or picture, they can share the picture to other people via the share button in the app. Finally, if the user gets stuck on how to use the app, there is a help button available with instructions. In this project,I learned more about coding and the importance of making everything specific through many mistakes. We worked well together and were efficient. A lot of research went into this project and we were very proud of the result.</p><br>
